== BrownianMotion.Elm

This little demo app simulates Brownian motion of a single particle.
It uses the included `Graph.elm` library to map Cartesian to screen
coordinates and provide other conveniences.

Some further directions, which I may or may not explore:

- Add fields to control various parameters, e.g.,
the size of the square within within which the particle moves,
the radius of particle, the time between updates, etc. Perhaps
change the field of motion from a square to a circle.

- Experiment with the "rebound" algorithm, which determines what
happens when the particle collides with a wall.

- Simulate the motion of more than one particle.

- Display a graph of the distance of the particle from the origin
as a function of time.

== Installation

Run `make-elm src/BrowniamMotion.elm`, then open the `index.html` file.
