== BrownianMotion.Elm

This little demo app simulates Brownian motion of a single particle.
It uses the included `Graph.elm` library to map Cartesian to screen
coordinates and provide other conveniences.

Some further directions, which I may or may not explore:

- Add fields to control various parameters, e.g.,
the size of the "playground" within within which the particle moves,
the radius of particle, the time between updates, etc.

- Simulate the motion of more than one particle.

- Record the history of the particle and display it.  This can give
 quite beautiful images, especially if one accompanies the random
walk in the xy-plane with a random walk in RGB color space using a
well-chosen value of the opacity.

- Display a graph of the distance of the particle from the origin
as a function of time.

== Installation

Run `make-elm src/BrowniamMotion.elm`, then open the `index.html` file.
